# Background and Goals  
This project was created while developing cloud-based solutions. We needed a state management solution made for our stateless services.  - Manage definition entity states, the rules for transitioning between states, and how to handle actions while in each state.
- **Stateless** so it's thread safe and a single state machine can be used to manage state for all managed instances  
- **Intuitive configuration** of [state change conditions](https://github.com/scottctr/NStateManager/wiki/Changing-States), [behaviors based on current state](https://github.com/scottctr/NStateManager/wiki/Event-Actions), and [actions when changing states](https://github.com/scottctr/NStateManager/wiki/State-Change-Actions)  
- **[async/await support](https://github.com/scottctr/NStateManager/wiki/Async-Await-Support)**, including cancellation and ConfigureAwait       
# Quick Example
Managing state of a Sale for a simple point-of-sale system.

### Configuring the state machine
```C#
//State machine to manage sales for a point of sale system
stateMachine = new StateMachine<Sale, SaleState, SaleEvent>(
  stateAccessor: (sale) => sale.State,                //stateAccessor is used to retrieve the current state
  stateMutator: (sale, state) => sale.State = state); //stateMutator updates state based on transition rule below

//Log each time a sale changes state regardless of to/from state
stateMachine.RegisterOnTransitionedAction((sale, transitionDetails) 
  => Output.WriteLine($"Sale {sale.SaleID} transitioned from {transitionDetails.PreviousState} to {transitionDetails.CurrentState}."));

//Configure the Open state
stateMachine.ConfigureState(SaleState.Open)
  //Process the new item on the AddItem event 
  .AddTriggerAction<SaleItem>(SaleEvent.AddItem, (sale, saleItem) => { sale.AddItem(saleItem); })
  //Process the payment on the Pay event
  .AddTriggerAction<Payment>(SaleEvent.Pay, (sale, payment) => { sale.AddPayment(payment); })
  //Transition to the ChangeDue state on Pay event if customer over pays
  .AddTransition(SaleEvent.Pay, SaleState.ChangeDue, condition: sale => sale.Balance < 0, name: "Open2ChangeDue", priority: 1)
  //Transition to the Completed state on Pay event if customer pays exact amount
  .AddTransition(SaleEvent.Pay, SaleState.Complete, condition: sale => sale.Balance == 0, name: "Open2Complete", priority: 2);

//Configure the ChangeDue state
stateMachine.ConfigureState(SaleState.ChangeDue)
  //Process the returned change on the ChangeGiven event
  .AddTriggerAction<Payment>(SaleEvent.ChangeGiven, (sale, payment) => { sale.ReturnChange(); })
  //Transition to the Complete state on ChangeGiven -- no conditions
  .AddTransition(SaleEvent.ChangeGiven, SaleState.Complete);

//No configuration required for Complete state since it's a final state and
//no state transitions or actions are allowed at this point
```
### Using the state machine
```C#
//Add an item to a sale
stateMachine.FireTrigger(sale, SaleEvent.AddItem, saleItem); 

//Add a payment to a sale
stateMachine.FireTrigger(sale, SaleEvent.Pay, payment);

//Give the customer their change
stateMachine.FireTrigger(sale, SaleEvent.ChangeGiven, payment);
```
